# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Movement Prediction using ANN

This project uses a deep learning model (Artificial Neural Network) to predict whether a stock's price will go up or down based on historical features like Open, Close, High, Low, Volume, and EWMA (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average).

## ðŸš€ Model Overview

- **Architecture**: Fully connected neural network with dropout and ReLU activations.
- **Loss Function**: Binary Crossentropy
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Batch Size**: [Specify here if known]
- **Epochs**: [Specify here]
- **Framework**: Keras (TensorFlow backend)

## ðŸ“Š Features Used

- Open Price
- Close Price
- High
- Low
- Volume
- EWMA (Exponential Weighted Moving Average)

## ðŸ§  Labels

The label column (`new_col`) is binary:
- `1` â†’ Stock went up
- `0` â†’ Stock went down
